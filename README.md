# Arduino_ObstacleDetection
In this project I have tried to use maximum amount of components like Ultasonic Sensor,Infrared remote,LCD,etc I learnt in my Udemy Course.This is a obstacle detection
model based on simple alarming system using LEDs.The program stops working if the obstacle is near to board at a particular distance.We can control the board by the Infrared Remote.
There are two sketches as the online Tinckecad simulator supports lower version of Infrared library,hence a seperate code for it.
This is my first project on simple idea,it can be further extended and new ideas are welcome/
